# Towards Understanding Limitations of Pixel Discretization Against Adversarial Attacks
This project is for the paper [Towards Understanding Limitations of Pixel Discretization Against Adversarial Attacks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07816.pdf). Some codes are from [MNIST Challenge](https://github.com/MadryLab/mnist_challenge) and [CIFAR10 Challenge](https://github.com/MadryLab/cifar10_challenge). 

## Preliminaries
It is tested under Ubuntu Linux 16.04.1 and Python 3.6 environment, and requries tensorflow package to be installed:
* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install)
* [scipy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy)
* [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
